          <h2>Overview of the Presidential Election Process</h2>
          <p>
            The election process starts in the spring of the year before an
            election. Candidates will register with the Federal Election
            Comission to run and announce their intentions to run. Then, primary
            and caucus debates take place. Following this, States and parties
            hold presidential primaries and caucuses. After that, parties will
            hold nominating conventions to choose their candidates. Then,
            candidates will participate in presidential debates. Finally,
            election day is in early November of election year.
          </p>
          <h2>Requirements for Presidential Candidates</h2>
          <p>
            (1) Be a natural-born citizen of the United States, (2) Be at least
            35 years old, (3) Have been a resident of the United States for 14
            years
          </p>
          <h2>Primaries, Caucuses, and National Conventions</h2>
          <p>
            6-9 months before a presidential election, most states will host
            primaries. Here, primary voters anonymously choose their preferred
            canddiate. Several states hold caucuses, which are meetings run by
            political parties held at the county, district, or precinct level.
            How these states choose their candidates vary, some by secret
            ballot, others by group. Once delegates are selected by either
            method, they go on to represent their state at the national
            convention, for their respective party. At the national convention,
            a delegate gets voted to become their party's presidential nominee.
            This is also where the nominee will announce their running mate, who
            would become the Vice President-elect upon winning the election.
          </p>
          <h2>General Election and the Electoral College</h2>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 2rem">
            Here, citizens will vote on who they would like to be president.
            But, it's actually the electoral college who decides which candidate
            becomes president. This is an old tradition set by the United States
            in 1787. Each state has a set number of electoral votes based on
            population, which you can see in the interactive map on your right.
            Most states' electors will vote based on whoever wins the majority
            in their state. This means if a candidate wins the majority of
            California for example, California will cast their electoral votes
            for that candidate. Whoever has the most electoral college votes at
            the end then becomes President-elect.
